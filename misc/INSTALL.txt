installation
	create new database newznab
	add new user with only rights to newznab db
	import \db\schema.sql into newznab db (if this doesnt work piping in, use a query editor)
	copy \www\config.php.dist to \www\config.php and edit all settings
	chmod -R 777 \www\lib\smarty\template_c
	restart iis/apache
	browse to http://localhost/ and should see newznab homepage with default content.
	newznab.site database table contains configurable info about your site.
	register and update the users.role to 2 to set that user as administrator
	goto \admin\site-edit.php and customise fields to your installation.
	call \admin\group-update.php to populate database with your groups based on your groupfilter.
	call \admin\binary-update.php to populate database with binaries + parts.
	call \admin\release-update.php to create releases from all complete binary sets.

running	outside of root website
	set /htaccess RewriteBase to your virtual directory
	
how it works
	groups are specified, message headers (binaries and parts) are downloaded for the 
	groups, releases are created from completed sets of binaries. releases are categorised
	by the group they came from, or by the regexing message subject
	
choosing newsgroups
	which newsgroups are indexed is specified as a regular expression in the column 
	site.groupfilter. so if you want to index the groups alt.bin.blah.* and alt.bin.other
	use the value 'alt.bin.blah.*|alt.bin.other'
	
categorisation
	\www\lib\category.php contains the logic which attempts to map a group or a release to a 
	site category. site categories are used to make browsing nzbs easier. add new categories
	by updating the category table, and adding a new Category::constant. Then map it in the
	function determineCategory()
	
updating index (populating binaries + parts)
	updating the index can take ages depending on how much retention you require
	as such its not recommended to run update scripts from web browsers, as typically
	timeouts will occur. the recommended way to schedule updates is via a cron task 
	similar to that in /misc/cron_update.
	crontab -e
	*/15 * * * * /path/to/newznab/misc/cron_update/newznab_update.sh
	if you move around the files, you may need to set the path to the root of the newznab
	www files in the config.php file

updating newsgroups
	updating the list of available newsgroups is only worthwhile if you change your 
	site.groupfilter or categorisation. It can be done via web browser in /admin/groups-update. 
	
google ads/analytics
	to integrate google analytics and adsense provide enter the adsense ad module ids 
	into the site table for the menu (top), sidepanel (right), searchbox (bottom of menu). 
	providing an analytics id will include the analytics js in the footer

admin
	admin functions all live in /admin/ which is only accessible by users with admin role.
	set users.role to be 2 on the users you wish to be admins

tvrage
	after release-update is called, an attempt to determine the tvrageids for every release
	which looks like its tv. this also works out the series/episode columns. the data in the 
	tvrage table will become populated from best guesses from the rage search api. if some of these
	guesses are wrong, you can manually edit the rage data in the admin interface, and use the 
	remove link to wipe any releases which have that rageid and then manually call 'process tv' which
	will attempt to relink rage data. when a new release is created it goes in with a release.rageid of -1
	when tv is processed, the rageid either goes to the best guess, or to -2, which indicates no match 
	could be made, or the release isnt percieved to by tv.
	
content/cms
	pages can be added to the site with seo friendly urls via the /admin/ edit content links
	
skinning
	avoid custom edits to code and stylesheets to make updating painless. 
	override any styles by editing the file \www\theme\style.css. stick any custom images in
	\www\theme\images\
api
	www.newznab.com/api? provides api access to query and retrieve nzbs.
	call with no parameters to see help doc with all available options. users either have to be logged in
	or provide the site apikey. its intended that a site owner has to give out this key. if the 
	key is blank no api is available
	
faqs
	* authorisation rejected from nntp server - check you have enough available connections 
	not currently in use
	* Fatal error: Call to undefined function mhash() - missing mcrypt and mhash php library includes
	* white screen - probably php error not being displayed to browser or session timed out and 403 being throw
	
debugging
	switch php.ini error_reporting to E_ALL and ensure logging to browser is enabled.
	
development
	\db\schema.sql is latest database schema. should be able to rerun in and create new blank schema
	\misc\ for general docs and useful info, nothing in here is referenced by the application
	\misc\cron_update shell script and php files to call the updating of index from cli
	\www\lib\framework few general classes for db/http code
	\www\lib\smarty copy of a fairly recent smarty lib
	\www\lib\ all classes used in the app, typically named same as its database entity
	\www\templates\admin all templates used by the admin pages
	\www\templates\ all templates used by the user pages
	\www\admin\ all php pages used by the admin
	\www\theme\ blank area for implementation specific ui customisations
	\www\includes js dumping ground
	\www\api.php all functionality related to api calls into newznab
