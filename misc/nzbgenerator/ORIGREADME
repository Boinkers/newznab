This software allows everyone to start an NNTP indexing service with NZB generator.
This software is FREE and provided AS IS !
Use it at you own risk, although nothing could go wrong i think.

This software depends on the PEAR NNTP package and needs apache, php and mysql.

Some brief comments:

db.php: file where mysql database connection is made
deloldbinaries.php: purge binaries older than $retention days and is run from the commandline
index.php: generates the website with search engine and nzb download tools
nzb.class.php: the class that makes things work :)
update.php: this dowloads the headers from specified groups, run from commandline
updategrouplist.php: is used to fetch the entire grouplist from the server and updates it in the database
nntp.sql:	The sql structure

The is plenty inline comment, so you must be able to figure stuff out :)

My setup is:

MySQL version: 4.0.23
PHP version: 4.3.9
Apache version: 2.0.54
